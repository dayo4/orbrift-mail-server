## About
This was basically used to manage mails and project enquiries from my website. It was extracted from my full-fledged nodejs backend just to include only relevent mailing endpoints hosted with Vercel serverless features.

### Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- NPM (v7 or higher)

### Installation

Follow these steps to it set up on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install 
   ```

4. Start the local development server: 

   If using vercel, install vercel globally
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```
   Then login to vercel... You can visit vercel website or other serverless hosting of your choice to learn its local dev processes.

5. Deploy to Vercel or your favorite serveless architecture..
